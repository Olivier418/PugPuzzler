"""A step-by-step view of the solver's branching rule, for tutorial/1_solver.ipynb.

Every node is computed with the kernel's own primitives (choose_item, the
live-placement counters and collectors), so what is shown is exactly what
the search does at that node. walk replays the search node by node, trying
the branches in order and backing out of dead ends, until it finds the
first solution.
