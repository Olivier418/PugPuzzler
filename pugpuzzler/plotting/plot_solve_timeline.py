    """Timeline plot: one row per difficulty (the game's tiers, then the
    bounds' tags), one column per puzzle, y = time (log scale, shared by
    every row). A thin gray horizontal line marks every solution found;
    the first solution for each puzzle is drawn thicker, in the puzzle's
    difficulty color. A faint, difficulty-colored rectangle behind each
    column's lines spans the full time the solver ran on that puzzle
    (stats[name].duration) -- not just the window between its first and
    last solution, since the solver may keep searching after the last
    solution was already found. Every row starts at the left edge and
    spans as many column slots as the largest tier, so all columns are
    the same width and line up across rows; within a row, puzzles keep
    the order they have in `stats` (e.g. their source JSON's), rather
    than names sorted as strings ("10" before "2").

    Timing (duration/elapsed) comes from `stats`. Difficulty is read off
    each puzzle, found by name in `puzzles` (any mapping covering every
    puzzle in `stats`, e.g. the PuzzleBook from load_run_books or the book that
    was solved); colors are plot_puzzle_stats'.
