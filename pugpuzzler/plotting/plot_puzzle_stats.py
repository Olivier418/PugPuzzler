    `time_to_first_solution`, `time_to_last_solution`, `solve_time`), or
    are a `Metric` of your own.
    Metrics flagged `log` (counts, times) get a log axis, so their values
    must be positive: a puzzle with no solutions has no time to its first
    one, and one with zero solutions can't sit on a log axis, so both are
    left out. A 3D axis can't be log-scaled, so there the values are
    log10'd and the ticks labeled as powers of ten instead.

    Difficulty and filled-cell count are read off each puzzle, found by
    name in `puzzles` (any mapping covering every puzzle in `stats`, e.g.
    the PuzzleBook from load_run_books or the book that was solved); the solution
    count and timings come from `stats`.

    Puzzles that land on the same point (same values, same color) are
    drawn as one dot labeled with all their names, since they'd otherwise
    hide each other. Near-ties, and ties with an overlaid plot's dots, stay
    as they are.

    compute_puzzle_bounds' own tags (HARDEST_DIFFICULTY,
    EASIEST_DIFFICULTY) are colored from constants.BOUND_COLORS rather
    than constants.DIFFICULTY_COLORS, since they aren't the game's own
    difficulty tiers.

    Pass an existing `ax` to overlay on it rather than starting a fresh
    plot. The axes are the plot's, not the call's: an `ax` this function
    made already knows its metrics, so an overlay needs no `x`/`y`/`z` (and
    naming a different one raises rather than silently mixing quantities);
    its legend is extended with any difficulty it lacks rather than being
    rebuilt. A 3D `ax` from elsewhere needs `z`.
