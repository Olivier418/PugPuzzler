"""The solution bounds of a board: for every attainable number of filled
cells, the fewest solutions (the lower bound, the hardest puzzle) and the most
(the upper bound, the easiest) any puzzle with that many filled cells has --
exactly, from the empty board (0 filled, every solution) out to one block
short of a full board, with one example puzzle per bound per filled count
(also where the bound is 1).

Since Setup._validate_area guarantees the blocks' total area equals the
board's, a puzzle's filled count depends only on *which* blocks are
pre-placed, so the search is over subsets of blocks. Each subset's
*realizations* are its placements that leave the board solvable. Pre-placing
blocks never creates a solution, it only rules them out: a realization's
solutions are exactly the empty board's solutions that place those blocks
the same way. So with every empty-board solution as a row of placement
indices (Solution.rows of a complete solve of the empty puzzle), a
subset's realizations and their solution counts are the groups the rows
fall into by that subset's columns -- no solver call needed. Nothing is
sampled or estimated.

bound_counts does that grouping for every subset: a DFS that grows a
subset one (higher) block at a time, each child's groups refining its
parent's. Two facts keep it cheap:

  - A realization with a unique solution stays unique however many further
    blocks are placed the way that solution places them, so it settles the
    minimum of every superset at 1 at once.
  - A child's groups never outgrow its parent's. Once the minimum is settled
    below a node, only groups big enough to beat the maximum at some filled
    count still reachable from it are passed on; the rest of the rows are
    dropped for the whole subtree.

The bounds' puzzles are then solved once more, on solving.timed_solve's
clock, for their SolveStats (and each count is checked against the
grouping's). Nothing here reads or writes files: serialization.save_bounds /
load_bounds keep both books -- puzzles and stats -- in the board's bounds
folder, bounds/<game>/<board_key>/."""
