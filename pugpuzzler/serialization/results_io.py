"""What solving produces, on disk: runs in solutions/, benchmark trials in
benchmarks/ (written by benchmark.py) and a board's bounds in bounds/.

Two file formats, each one layout whether it holds one puzzle or a book:

  solutions.json  [{"puzzle_name", "grids": [letter grid, ...]}, ...]
  stats.json      [{"puzzle_name", "options", "seed", "duration", "complete", "elapsed"}, ...]

and a book file (games_io.write_puzzles) for the bounds' puzzles. Where
they live:

  run      <root>/<Source.relative_dir()>/result_<idx>/{solutions.json, stats.json}
           (either file may be left out; see solving.solve_puzzle)
  benchmark <root>/<Source.relative_dir()>/benchmark_<idx>/<config label>/stats<seed>.json
  bounds   <root>/<game>/<board_key>/{lower,upper}_{puzzles,stats}.json

A run stores no puzzles, and no game or book name: its path names the game
and book (mirroring the puzzles' Source), the files name the puzzles, and
the puzzles are loaded from games/, which never changes (save_puzzlebook
only adds books) -- so a run can't go stale. Neither can a bounds folder,
whose letter grids describe themselves."""
