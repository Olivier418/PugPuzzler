    placed, every open cell covered exactly once) as a row: one int64 array
    holding the placement index of every block -- pre-placed ones included
    -- in block order. Setup.rows_to_grids turns rows into grids,
    Puzzle.solved_copy into a Puzzle.

    Stops early once a limit is hit. The generator's return value
    (what `yield from` evaluates to, or StopIteration.value) says
    whether it did: True if the search ran to the end, so every
    solution was yielded; False if a limit cut it short. This is what
    becomes SolveStats.complete.

    `time_limit` (seconds, counted from the first `next()`) and
    `max_solutions` both default to infinity; the search stops as soon
    as either is reached. The kernel is never told `max_solutions`: it
    gets a solution-buffer cap and a node budget, returns FULL/BUDGET/DONE,
    and is re-entered with its stack intact. An EMA of nodes/s sizes ~2 ms
    chunks, which is how `time_limit` stays exact to ~2 ms and how the
    generator stays abandonable mid-tree.

    `seed` randomises the order solutions are found in without
    changing the set: it draws one random priority per placement,
    used only to break ties the search's own ordering leaves open.
    Unseeded, ties fall to placement index order. Nothing is ever
    reordered or shared, so a seed can't disturb anything indexed by
    placement.

    Every node branches on one *item* and tries every placement that
    settles it, so the branches partition the node's solutions:
    nothing is missed and nothing is found twice. `branch` picks which
    kind of item, and only affects speed:

    - "both" (the default): whichever of the two below has fewer live
      placements at this node. The counts are directly comparable --
      a child of either kind places exactly one block -- so this is
      simply better informed than either alone, and it wins or ties
      everywhere.
    - "cell": always the empty cell with the fewest live placements.
    - "block": always the unplaced block with the fewest. Sound, and
      a useful baseline, but much the weakest: it cannot notice a
      cell that nothing can cover until some block runs out of room,
      so it prunes almost nothing where little is pre-filled. On a
      book puzzle that costs a factor (worst measured:
      main_puzzles/65, 2 s against 0.01 s); on the empty main board
      it finds no solution at all in 30 s, against ~1 ms for "both".

    Measurements for the three modes are in docs/SOLVER_NOTES.md.

    `order` ranks each node's candidate placements. It changes the
    order solutions come out in, never the set. The rank is a property
    of a placement rather than of the item that was branched on, so
    ordering is uniform across all three `branch` modes by
    construction.

    - True: each candidate's cells' live-placement counts, sorted
      ascending and compared like a tuple, so a placement covering the
      scarcest cells goes first.
    - False: table order (but see the seed note above).
    - None (the default): True exactly when a limit is set, which is
      when it can pay -- a full enumeration visits the same nodes
      whatever order siblings are tried in, so there it is pure
      overhead.
